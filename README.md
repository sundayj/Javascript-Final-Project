# Javascript-Final-Project
Upon completion of the Javascript class from the Midlands Technical College TechHire program, we were asked to follow specific directions to create our fourth simple webpage. Here, I will include all of the files for the project in order to show my beginnings as a web developer. Received a grade of "A."
<br/>
All instructor instructions are included in each of the actual files, respectively.
<br/>
The screenshot file is a screenshot of the final product using the instructor's example, as a guide for us to know we are on the right track.
<br/>
The main goal of the project was to practice Javascript, not to create a beautiful website.  When the user hovers over the "Sun," it is supposed to make the paragraph below disappear, when the user clicks "Mercury," it is supposed to show a popup with facts about Mercury, and when the user clicks Jupiter, a paragraph is supposed to appear above it with specific styling on certain lines.
<br/>
For extra credit, we were told to make the "Sun" and "Jupiter" spin when hovered over.
